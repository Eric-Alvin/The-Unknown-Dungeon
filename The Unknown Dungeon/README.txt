The Unknown Dungeon
====================
A Text-Adventure roguelike game
Made by Eric Krawczyk



Files
-------------------

README.txt -
	YOU ARE HERE!
	I hope you're having a great day! :)

Final Project folder - 
	(Get BlueJ to use this one)
	The original [V1.0] BlueJ project, see its README to run it.
	Has a secret that was removed in V1.1 
		(it requires the user to type in a command they shouldn't be putting into a command prompt, and triggers the program crashing itself)

TheUnknownDungeonRunnableEdition folder -
	(I reccomend Eclipse or another Java IDE for this one)
	Has the files for the current version [V1.1] of the game,
		useful if you're trying to modify it, 
		find secret commands, look at enemy stats,
		or just learning more about the game in general.

UnknownDungeon.jar -
	Executable Jar file, might not run on its own,
		so you'll probably want to use the batch file.

Play The Unknown Dungeon!.bat -
	Runs the jar file, use this to play the game!


How To Play
-----------------
Simply open "Play The Unknown Dungeon!.bat", 
	and type in your commands in the command prompt that opens.
If you lose, the game will close after a little while after the game over message appears.
Just open the batch file again to try again!

There are a few spelling mistakes and some of the text doesn't show up properly ("crerated", "this room is upside down", etc.).
I'll probably get around to this if I ever decide to re-make or fix up the game. 
There's other stuff I'd change too if I end up working on this again,
	I just wanted to get this in a playable state for the time being.

The game was made as a school project, and hasn't been modified much since then, 
	so I reccomend looking at the tips below to get the most out of it.



Tips
------------------
- Consider refraining from picking up items that are a downgrade from your current gear.
- There are secret commands (Some better than others), consider peeking at the code to find them!
- There's a lot of luck involved, it might not be possible to win if the dungeon generates poorly.
- You don't have to choose a class if you don't want to, though playing classless may make the game more difficult.
- Have fun!
